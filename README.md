# Job Board Application  

A professional job board web application built with **Laravel 12**, **MySQL**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.  
It allows users to browse jobs, apply with CVs, and for employers to post and manage job listings with strict access control and clean component-based UI.  

---

## ✨ Features  

### Authentication  
- User Registration & Login.  
- Guests can browse jobs but need to log in to apply or create jobs.  

### Jobs  
- Browse jobs (public).  
- Jobs include: title, location, salary, experience level (Entry/Intermediate/Senior), category (Marketing, Sales, Finance).  
- Soft deletes: deleted jobs are marked with a red "Deleted" badge.  
- Policies:  
  - Only the employer who created a job can delete it.  
  - Jobs with applications cannot be edited.  

### Applications  
- Users can apply to jobs with expected salary & CV upload.  
- A user cannot apply more than once to the same job.  
- Applicants can manage (view, delete) their own applications.  

### Employers  
- A user can create an **Employer profile** (only once).  
- Employers can create, edit, and delete their own jobs.  
- Employers can see applications submitted to their jobs.  
- Middleware `employer` ensures only employers can manage jobs and applications.
